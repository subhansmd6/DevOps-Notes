With the help of log

	•	git log
	•	Commit ID
	•	Author
	•	Date/Time
	•	Timestamp
	•	Initial change

When you perform commit command for the first time:

	•	git config –-global email “id”
	•	git config -–global user.name “name”

When we are performing git commit for the first time then the system will ask you who are you then you have to share the details which is required

Credential Manager

	•	If we are logging in with different git user ID then we have to go and change the credentials from credential manager.
	
Command to add branch
	•	git branch 

List the branch
	•	git branch

Switch to branch
	•	git switch 

If we want to check out from branch and shift into main branch
	•	git checkout 

If there is not a new branch in remote repo, which is created by us from that we use
	•	git push –-set-upstream origin 

The current branch has no upstream branch. To push the current branch and set the remote by upstream, we use:
	•	git push -–set-upstream origin 

PR means created branch with a main branch to save the data in the created branch to main branch.

WIP - Work in Progress

git branch -d 
	•	(For deleting branch)

First, we have to come out from that branch and switch to the main branch. Then only we can delete the branch which is created by us.

The Command: git stash
	•	With the help of git stash, we can pause or save the data which we have created in the local machine.

For resuming the stash:
	•	git stash pop

git stash list
	•	Shows how many tasks are on pause mode.
