```bash
usermod -aG wheel <username>

## Log Files for Tracking `sudo` Activity

  /var/log/auth.log
  ```

- **RHEL/CentOS:**
  ```
  /var/log/secure
  ```

---

## File Permissions

- **Creating a New Directory with Permissions:**
  ```
  mkdir <dir_name> && chmod 755 <dir_name>
  ```
  - `755` = rwxr-xr-x (Owner: read/write/execute, Group: read/execute, Others: read/execute)
