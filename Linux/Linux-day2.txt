**Shell Scripting**

**Date: 18-02-2025**

Shell scripting is a series of shell commands arranged in a text file to be executed one after the other.

- Helps to automate a sequence of tasks, creating and also saving time.
- Can be created using any normal text editor.

### Creating a Shell Script:

1. To get into the shell for execution, use `sudo su` and create a text file. Add the extension `.sh` at the shell:
 
   # vi script.sh
  
2. Enter some commands in the script to be executed:
 
   echo "My first script"
   echo $(date)
  
3. Change the permission of the script, give it executable permission, and may also give read and execute 
   permission for other users:
  
   # chmod 755 script.sh
  
4. Run the script:
   
   # ./script.sh  (or)
   # bash script.sh


### How to Create a File Using Shell Script:

1. Add shebang for the script:

   #! /bin/bash
 
2. Define the directory where the file will be created:
   
   DIR="/opt/"
  
3. Generate a file name with the current date and time:
  
   FILE_NAME="My-file-$(date +"%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M")"

4. Create the file:
   
   touch "$DIR/$FILE_NAME"
   
5. (Optional) Write something to the file:
  
   echo "This file was created on $(date)" > "$DIR/$FILE_NAME"
  

### Tasks:

1. Create a directory and also a file in that directory using a shell script.
2. Create `user1`, `user2`, `user3`, `user4`, and `user5` using a shell script.
3. Create `n` number of users using a file (where the file will have user data).
4. Print even numbers, odd numbers, and prime numbers using a script.

### User Management in Linux:

#### Key Concepts:

- **Users**: Represent individuals who can access the system.
- **Groups**: Collection of users that share common access permissions.
- **UID (User ID)** and **GID (Group ID)**: Numeric identities for users and groups.

#### Key Commands:

- **Creating a user with a password:**
   
   adduser <username>
 
   Example:
  
   adduser user1

- **Creating a user without a password:**
   
   useradd -m <username>

   Example:
  
   useradd -m user1

#### Task: How to Create a Password for the New User

1. Once we create a user, we can see the user information in `/etc/passwd` (where `passwd` is a file that contains user information).
2. We can see the passwords of the users in encrypted format in `/etc/shadow` (where `shadow` is a file).

**Task: What is the difference between creating a user using `adduser` and `useradd -m` commands?**

**Deleting a User:**

sudo deluser <username>

(OR)

sudo userdel -r <username>

**How to Connect to a Linux Server Using PuTTY:**

PuTTY is a software package that provides a feature to connect to machines/Linux servers.

To log in to a machine using PuTTY, we need a `.ppk` file (obtained while launching the instance).

**Steps to connect:**

1. Download the `.ppk` file.
2. Open PuTTY.
3. Enter the **hostname** or **IP address** of the Linux machine (public IP address).
4. Navigate to **Connection** → **SSH** → **Auth** → **Credentials**.
5. Upload the `.ppk` file.
6. Click on **Open**.
7. For the first time, click on **Accept** when prompted.
8. Login as `ubuntu` (default user for Ubuntu servers) or the appropriate username.
