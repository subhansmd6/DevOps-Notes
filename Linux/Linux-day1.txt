**What is Linux?**
Linux is an open-source operating system modeled on Unix and developed in the C language.

**Features of Linux:**
- It is reliable as it runs smoothly and does not need to be rebooted repeatedly.
- Significantly reduces the monitor cost.
- Linux is open source.
- Licensing freedom to re-use and re-publish the code.
- Can be customized.
- New enhancements and updates come frequently.
- More secure than other operating systems.

**Task:** What will happen when we turn on a computer/laptop?

**Components of Linux OS:**
- **Init program:** The first program responsible for the initialization of the system.
- **Boot loader:** A program that loads the operating system when the system is turned on.
- **Software Libraries:** A set of programming tools used to develop and design software programs and applications.
- **Package Management System:** A collection of tools for installation, deletion, configuration, and upgradation of software.
- **Other Interfaces and Applications:** Various applications and interfaces used for different tasks performed by users.

**Architecture of Linux:**
```
Hardware
    ↓
Kernel
    ↓
Shell
```

**Hardware:**
- **Kernel:** It is the interface between the applications and the actual process done at the hardware level.
- **Shell:** It is the interface that takes user commands and sends them to the kernel.

**How Shell Works:**
```
Command to be executed or shell script → Linux Shell → Converted to library language by Shell → Sent to Linux Kernel
```

**Task:** What is GNU or GNU tool?

**Linux Distributions:**
Some of the popular Linux distributions are Ubuntu, Fedora, RedHat, Debian, CentOS, etc.

**Types of Files in Linux:**
- `-` Normal file
- `d` Normal directory
- `l` Symbolic link
- `p` Pipe

**Run Levels in Linux:**
- 0 - Halt the system
- 1 - Single-user mode
- 2 - Multiple user mode with no network file system
- 3 - Multiple user mode in CLI, but no GUI
- 4 - User definable
- 5 - Multiple user mode in GUI
- 6 - Reboot

We can use these run levels with the `init` command. Example: `init 0`

**Pipe:**
- Pipe is represented as "|" and is used to direct the output of one command to another.
- Pipe is unidirectional, and data flows from left to right.

**Example:** `cat file.txt | grep Linux`
