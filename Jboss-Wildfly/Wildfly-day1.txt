--> Standalone Folder in WildFly
The 'standalone' folder contains configuration, deployments, and logs.

--> Configuration: Stores configurations for applications and user specifications.
(e.g., mgmt-users.properties, mgmt-groups.properties).

--> Logs: Stored in standalone --> logs --> Contains WildFly logs.

--> Deployment: Contains all deployed applications.
  - Examples: JAR, WAR, EAR, standalone archives such as RAR, or JBoss-specific deployments.
  - Deployments can be added via 'drag and drop'.

--> Deployment Method:
-Drag and drop new files to 'add' content or 'replace' existing deployments.
-If an existing deployment with the same name is found, it will be replaced; otherwise, it will 
be added as a new deployment.
