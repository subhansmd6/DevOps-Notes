Things to Keep in Mind Before Changing Configuration Changes:
--------------------------------------------------------------
1. Where to change
2. Backup
3. How to change
4. Try to do it in the local system first
5. Documentation

Snapshot / Backup:
-----------------
For WildFly - Configuration:
- Navigate to the home folder of WildFly
  - standalone -> configuration -> standalone_xml_history (Folder)
- File name: Standalone-V1

Example: Port number change
- Standalone-portchange-V2
- Need to rename the original file name with another name as per the requirement.

=============================================================================================================================

Different Status of the Artifacts Deployed in WildFly:
-----------------------------------------------------
- Deployed: Application is successfully running on the server and is accessible for users.
- Undeployed: Application has been removed from the server and is not running.
- Failed: Deployment process encountered an error and the app is not running.
- Disabled: The application is intentionally stopped by the admin and cannot be accessed until enabled.
- Suspended: The application is temporarily paused and can be resumed later.
- Redeploying: The application is currently being updated with new code and is not fully available in this process.

Domain and Host Controller in WildFly:
-------------------------------------
In JBoss WildFly, a "domain controller" is the central management point for a group of servers within a domain, 
responsible for maintaining the overall configuration and policy. 
A "host controller" is a separate process running on each server within the domain, communicating with the domain 
controller to manage the individual server instances on that host machine.
Essentially, the domain controller dictates the overall configuration, and the host controllers execute those configurations 
on their respective servers.

=============================================================================================================================

Key Points About Domain and Host Controller:
-------------------------------------------
Domain Controller (Master):
1. Acts as the central management point for the entire domain.
2. Stores the domain-wide configuration in a file called "domain.xml".
3. Responsible for distributing configuration changes to all host controllers within the domain.

Host Controller (Slave):
1. Manages the application server instances running on a specific host.
2. Reads its configuration from a "host.xml" file specific to that host.
3. Communicates with the domain controller to receive configuration updates and start/stop server instances.
